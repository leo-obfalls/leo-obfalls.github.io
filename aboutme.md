This website is the digital object created in tandem with the thesis requirements of the Masterâ€™s program [Rare Book and Digital Humanities](http://formation.univ-fcomte.fr/master/humanites-numeriques).
It compliments our research into the written record of gynaecological medical knowledge and its transmission, reception and evolution.
We aim to reunite our selected texts in a virtual library and challenge the canon of existing thought surrounding the female body, from topics such as menstruation, pregnancy, abortion and birth. We seek to compare how modern science currently understands and communicates knowledge pertaining to the female body and present our findings using digital tools.
